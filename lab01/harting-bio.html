    </head>
    <body>My name is Caroline Harting. I am a psychology major interested in learning about social psychology, stigmas, and research. I have been awarded with the Invest in Success Scholarship from Syracuse University and have made the Deanâ€™s List every semester for the past two years. Outside of work, I am in a social sorority, and I like to spend a lot of my free time watching movies or TV shows. My favorite movie is Ella Enchanted, and my favorite TV show is How I Met Your Mother. I have one sibling, an older brother, and a dog named Lindsey. I currently have an internship working as a social media and branding intern and am passionate about learning and understanding the ever-growing knowledge and development of new technology.</body>
